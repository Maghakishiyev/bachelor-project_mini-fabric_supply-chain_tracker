# Mini-Fabric Supply Chain Project - Progress Update

## Current Status

We've made significant progress fixing several key issues:

1. ✅ Fixed Docker socket configuration for chaincode deployment
2. ✅ Implemented CCaaS (Chaincode as a Service) approach for deployment
3. ✅ Updated Gateway API usage in the listener service
4. ✅ Fixed certificate path configurations in docker-compose.yml
5. ✅ Fixed listener service's private key handling (fixed "unsupported key type: []uint8" error)
6. ✅ Added core.yaml configuration for peers (fixed "Config File 'core' Not Found" error)
7. ✅ Improved chaincode server implementation for CCaaS mode

However, we still have some remaining issues to address:

## Remaining Issues

1. **Chaincode Deployment Issues**: While we've made progress with the CCaaS approach, we're still facing problems with the chaincode commit process. The chaincode is installed on all peers, but commitment fails with "ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE".

2. **Frontend Connection Issues**: The webapp is still unable to connect to the chaincode with error "no peers available to evaluate chaincode shipping in channel supplychain".

## Steps for Next Session

### 1. Fix Chaincode Commitment

We need to investigate why the endorsement policy is failing:

```bash
# Check the channel and chaincode readiness
docker exec cli peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness --channelID supplychain --name shipping --version 1.0 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --output json

# Check peer logs for endorsement failure details
docker logs peer0.manufacturer.example.com | grep -i endorsement
```

Potential solutions:
- Try a simpler endorsement policy (e.g., "OR('ManufacturerMSP.member')")
- Check if the chaincode server is properly started and can be reached by peers
- Ensure the connection.json in the chaincode package correctly points to the CCaaS container

### 2. Fix Frontend-to-Chaincode Connection

Once the chaincode is properly committed, we need to ensure the frontend can connect:

```bash
# Check gateway connection parameters
docker exec webapp env | grep MSP
docker exec webapp env | grep PEER
```

Potential fixes:
- Update the app's environment variables to match the peer MSP and endpoints
- Ensure the webapp has the correct TLS certificates mounted
- Check if there's proper network connectivity between the webapp and peers

### 3. Final Verification Steps

Once issues 1 and 2 are resolved:

1. Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000
2. Create a new shipment
3. Verify the shipment appears in the dashboard
4. Run a load test to verify performance:
   ```bash
   make loadtest
   make metrics
   ```

## Solutions Implemented So Far

1. **Listener Service Fix**:
   - Fixed key parsing in connect.go for Fabric Gateway v1.7.1
   ```go
   privateKey, err := identity.PrivateKeyFromPEM(keyPem)
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("failed to parse private key: %v", err)
   }
   
   sign, err := identity.NewPrivateKeySign(privateKey)
   ```

2. **Peer Configuration Fix**:
   - Added core.yaml to project directory
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to mount the config file and set FABRIC_CFG_PATH

3. **CCaaS Implementation**:
   - Created connection.json for external chaincode service
   - Updated metadata.json to indicate CCaaS type
   - Modified main.go to support CCaaS mode
   - Added shipping-ccaas service to docker-compose.yml

## Future Enhancements

After resolving the current issues:

1. Implement CouchDB rich queries for more advanced filtering
2. Add user authentication to the frontend application
3. Enhance metrics collection for better performance reporting
4. Improve the CCaaS implementation with proper TLS support
