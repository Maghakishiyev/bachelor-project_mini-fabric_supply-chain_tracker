# Mini-Fabric Supply Chain Project - Next Steps

## Current Status

We've made significant progress fixing several key issues:

1. Fixed Docker socket configuration for chaincode deployment
2. Implemented CCaaS (Chaincode as a Service) approach for deployment
3. Updated Gateway API usage in the listener service
4. Fixed certificate path configurations in docker-compose.yml

However, we still have some remaining issues to address:

## Steps for Next Session

### 1. Complete Chaincode Deployment

Run the full chaincode deployment process:

```bash
# Start with a clean environment
make clean

# Generate crypto materials
make generate

# Start the network
make network-up

# Create and join channel
make channel-create
make channel-join

# Deploy chaincode using our new CCaaS approach
make cc-deploy
```

### 2. Test Chaincode Functionality

After deployment, verify that the chaincode is properly deployed:

```bash
# Test with basic transactions
make test

# Check if the chaincode has been properly committed
docker exec cli peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted -C supplychain -n shipping
```

### 3. Start Applications

Once the chaincode is deployed, start the applications:

```bash
# Prepare wallet files
make wallets

# Start the event listener
make listener-up

# Start the frontend application
make app-up

# Start monitoring (optional)
make monitoring
```

### 4. Verify End-to-End Functionality

1. Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000
2. Create a new shipment
3. Verify the shipment appears in the dashboard
4. Run a load test to verify performance:
   ```bash
   make loadtest
   make metrics
   ```

### 5. Common Issues & Solutions

If you encounter issues:

1. **Docker Socket Issues**: The chaincode deployment may fail with "failed to build chaincode: docker image inspection failed..." - Check the Docker socket path in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Certificate/TLS Issues**: If you see TLS handshake errors, verify that the TLS paths in the peer configurations, the listener service, and the frontend application are all correct.

3. **Listener Service Errors**: Check for any dependency mismatches in services/listener/go.mod - Make sure the fabric-gateway version is set to v1.7.1.

4. **Frontend Connection Issues**: If the frontend cannot connect to the blockchain, check the certificate paths in docker-compose.yml for the app service.

5. **Chaincode Server Issues**: If the chaincode service crashes or is not found, check the logs with `docker logs shipping-ccaas` and verify the container is running.

## Future Enhancements

After resolving the current issues, we can focus on these enhancements:

1. Implement CouchDB rich queries for more advanced filtering
2. Add user authentication to the frontend application
3. Enhance metrics collection for better performance reporting
4. Improve the CCaaS implementation with proper TLS support
